# Regression Problems – Diabetes Dataset

This repository contains a regression analysis on the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn, implemented as part of a university assignment.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to compare multiple regression models for predicting disease progression using tabular medical data. The models are evaluated using 6-fold cross-validation and multiple regression performance metrics.

## 🧠 Models Implemented
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
- Gaussian Process Regressor

## 📊 Evaluation Methodology
- 6-fold K-Fold cross-validation
- Evaluation on the **test set only** for model comparison
- Performance metrics:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - Max Error
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

## 🔍 Explainability (SHAP)
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret the predictions of the selected models.
- SHAP summary plots
- SHAP waterfall plots (for representative test samples)

## 📁 Repository Structure
## diabetes_regression.ipynb
## regression_results.csv
## README.md
The file `regression_results.csv` contains the aggregated results from all folds, models, and datasets (train/test).

⚠️ **Note:**  
The CSV file is generated by the notebook.  
To regenerate it, uncomment the last lines at the end of `diabetes_regression.ipynb` and re-run the notebook.

📄 Generated Results (CSV)
The file regression_results.csv contains the aggregated evaluation results for all regression models, including both training and test sets across all folds.

This file is generated automatically by the notebook during execution.

🧪 Reproducibility
A fixed random seed is used to ensure reproducible results.
Feature scaling and preprocessing are applied within each fold to prevent data leakage.
The dataset is loaded directly from the scikit-learn library.

🎓 Academic Context
This project was developed as part of a university assignment for the course
Machine Learning at the University of Macedonia.
