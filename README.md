This repository contains a regression analysis on the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn, implemented as part of a university assignment.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to compare multiple regression models for predicting disease progression using tabular medical data. The models are evaluated using 6-fold cross-validation and multiple regression performance metrics.

## Models Implemented
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
- Gaussian Process Regressor

## Evaluation Methodology
- 6-fold K-Fold cross-validation
- Evaluation on the **test set only** for model comparison
- Performance metrics:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - Max Error
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

## Explainability (SHAP)
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret the predictions of the selected models.
- SHAP summary plots
- SHAP waterfall plots (for representative test samples)

## How to Run

### Recommended: Run on Google Colab
The easiest way to run this project is through **Google Colab**, as the notebook is fully self-contained and requires no local setup.

- Click the **“Open in Colab”** button at the top of this README.
- Run all cells sequentially.
- (Optional) To export the results locally, uncomment the CSV download lines at the end of the notebook and re-run it.

This option is recommended for quick experimentation and reproducibility.

### Alternative: Run Locally
You may also download the notebook and run it locally using Jupyter Notebook.

Steps:
1. Download the file `diabetes_regression.ipynb` from this repository.
2. Ensure the required Python libraries are installed (e.g. `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `shap`).
3. Open the notebook and run all cells.

Note: Running locally may require additional setup compared to Google Colab.

## Repository Structure
## diabetes_regression.ipynb
## regression_results.csv
## README.md
The file `regression_results.csv` contains the aggregated results from all folds, models, and datasets (train/test).

## **Note:**  
The CSV file is generated by the notebook.  
To regenerate it, uncomment the last lines at the end of `diabetes_regression.ipynb` and re-run the notebook.

## Generated Results (CSV)
The file regression_results.csv contains the aggregated evaluation results for all regression models, including both training and test sets across all folds.

This file is generated automatically by the notebook during execution.

## Reproducibility
A fixed random seed is used to ensure reproducible results.
Feature scaling and preprocessing are applied within each fold to prevent data leakage.
The dataset is loaded directly from the scikit-learn library.

## Academic Context
This project was developed as part of a university assignment for the course
Machine Learning at the University of Macedonia.
